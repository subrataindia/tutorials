# GIT

Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that is widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project by managing and tracking changes to the source code. Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has become a standard tool in the software development industry.

# GITHUB

GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It adds a graphical interface and additional features to Git, making it easier to collaborate on projects. GitHub allows developers to share their code with others, contribute to open-source projects, and manage their code repositories more effectively.

## In summary:

- Git is the version control system itself, a tool for tracking changes in source code.
- GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories, adding a user-friendly interface and collaborative features.

While Git can be used without GitHub, GitHub leverages the power of Git and provides a platform for collaboration, code review, issue tracking, and more. There are also other platforms similar to GitHub, such as GitLab and Bitbucket, which offer similar services but may have different features and pricing structures.
